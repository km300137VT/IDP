  /* 
  The logic of the timer works like this:
  - Begin timer register (internal) at 0
  - Count upward by 1 each clock cycle
  - When the timer reaches the threshold value in OCR1A, it toggles the output pin on
  - When it reaches the top value stored in ICR1, it starts counting downward
  - Once the counter drops below the OCR1A threshold again, it toggles the output pin off
  - Finally, when the counter hits 0, it begins counting upward again, repeating the cycle

  Thus, the frequency can be calculated by 16,000,000 (the clock frequency) / ICR1 / 2 (since it counts up and then back down instead of resetting at the top)
  and the duty cycle can be calculated by OCR1A / ICR1 (threshold divided by top value)
